# Python-GUI-for-Calculating-and-Plotting-the-optimum-operation-parameter-for-Robotic-Motion
This work is a continues improvement for the project PIP, in which the motion parameters of a robot have been calculated. Ruther than using normal code, a GUI in Python has been developed for this project.  
The jupyter notebook which has been deveoped in the original project has been included here as well as the project report.
